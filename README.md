### Brief overview of the game

Yukon has the following adjustments to the game-play of standard Klondike solitaire:

* There are 7 rows of tableau stacks, and 4 foundations that build up in suit (see screenshots to the right)

* Groups of cards can be moved; the cards below the one to be moved do not need to be in any order, except that the starting and target cards must be built in sequence and in alternate color.  For example, a group starting with a Red 3 can be moved on top a Black 4, and the cards below the Red 3 can differ.

* There is no stock in Yukon. All cards are dealt at the beginning; however, some are face down.
